# CS-255

#.Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
   
   This project was for a client - DriverPass. What they hope to achieve is to help students wanting to take driver's tests. The project deals with creating an application that trains drivers/students who want to obtain a license from the DMV. The system would 
   allow them to take classes and provide them with materials and lessons (online and in-person), as well as driving sessions to enable them to prepare for the process of getting a driver's license. The application would be accessible with an internet connection from any 
   device and location.

#.What did you do particularly well?

   I think I did an excellent job on the UML diagrams, doing my best to add the basic functionalities and display the correct relationships between users, actors, and involved parties.

#.If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

   We were allowed to compare our diagrams with our classmates during the class. After seeing some of my classmates' diagrams, I realized that there were things I needed to add. One such thing would be better security in my activity and sequence diagrams. 
   The diagrams are to contain loops and sections dealing with the security of the user's account. The loop would include a stored value for failed password attempts. If the number of attempts is exhausted, the account is then locked.

#.How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

   The user wanted specific roles assigned for the management of the system, which I implemented through the use of the admin role and their overarching access to the system. While I did not fully display this in my class Diagram, that is the case. The admin can 
   manage accounts and other services the system provides. Also, the owner has complete access to all functions and users of the system, even the admins themselves.

#.How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

   I usually like to have a blueprint for development. With these diagrams and design documents, I have a blueprint from which to progress. Working through the class diagram and the rest of the UML diagrams, I can fully develop and analyze a system.
